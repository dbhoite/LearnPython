Python Libraries

csv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) : very convenient for reading and writing csv files
collections (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) : useful extensions of the usual data types including OrderedDict, defaultdict and namedtuple
random (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) : generates pseudo-random numbers, shuffles sequences randomly and chooses random items
string (https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html) : more functions on strings. This module also contains useful collections of letters like string.digits (a string containing all characters with are valid digits).
re (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) : pattern-matching in strings via regular expressions
math (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) : some standard mathematical functions
os (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) : interacting with operating systems
os.path (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html) : submodule of os for manipulating path names
sys (https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) : work directly with the Python interpreter
json (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) : good for reading and writing json files (good for web work)
